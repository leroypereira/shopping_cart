    PermissionsMixin leverage built-in django model permissions system

    Note: They're not split in different tables because of simplicity of development.
    Some libraries assume there is only one user model, and they can't work with both.
    For example to have a history log of changes for entities - to save which user made a change of object attribute,
    perhaps, auth-related libs, and some other.
    With current implementation we don't need to fork, adapt and maintain third party packages.
    They should work out of the box.
    The disadvantage is - cognito-users will have unused fields which always empty. Not so critical.
